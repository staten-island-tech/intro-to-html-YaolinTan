    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h6>By Yaolin</h6>
    <P>My name is Yaolin. I'm a senior at Staten Island Technical High School. This is my about me page. Attached below is my school website. And below that are things I like and don't like. I also attached a meme at the bottom. This is the first HTML I've coded in years and I'm excited to learn more and hopefully apply this in the real world, getting a 5 on another AP exam wouldn't hurt either. I don't know a lot about coding and I'm ready to learn</P>
